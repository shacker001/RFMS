                    <b> Who we are</b>
                    <br>
                    AIAP stands for the Association of Irrigation Acceleration Platform. We are national, non-profit
                    membership association, registered under the Societies Act in Kenya. AIAP is a forum for stakeholder
                    converge in the irrigation (defined to include drainage) sector and its diverse value chain actors.
                    The Association provides a “Platform” for interaction, knowledge sharing, actions and building of
                    synergies to support and upscale irrigation best practices, policy and an enabling environment for
                    profitability and sector growth in Kenya. Irrigation opens up many opportunities to improve food
                    security, incomes and livelihoods, as rainfed agriculture has become unreliable.

                    <b> Whom we serve</b>
                    <br>
                    We are dedicated bridging the technology, policy, information and knowledge gaps across the
                    irrigation sector’s wide range of actors and stakeholders. These include, but not limited
                    to:individual farmers who irrigate or wish to become irrigators, irrigation-relevant organizations
                    such as; farmer groups, water users associations (IWUAs), commodity marketing groups, SACCOs and
                    companies. We also bring together professionals, researchers, officers working in the public and
                    private sectors, consultants, traders and market operators, financial sector actors, technology
                    developers, wholesale and retail outlets, policy makers, development partners, NGOs and
                    international organizations operating in Kenya. Ultimately, we serve all those involved in or
                    interested in the good and growth of irrigation sector in Kenya.

                        <b>Our vision</b><br>
                        To reduce hunger and extreme poverty by improving productivity of rice and other crops based on
                        environment-friendly agricultural practices that preserve and improve the natural resource base
                        and help to better withstand changing climate conditions.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Our mission</b><br>
                        To advance and share knowledge about the System of Rice Intensification, to improve the
                        technical implementation of the SRI methodology, and to support networking among interested
                        organizations agencies, and individuals around the globe.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Our goals:</b><br>
                        Make knowledge easily accessible to any interested farmer in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and
                        beyond <br>
                        Advance the application of ecological agriculture by further developing SRI and integrating it
                        with other agro-ecological approaches <br>
                        Improve the science-based understanding of how and why crops planted with SRI principles achieve
                        improved performance and productivity <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Our objectives:</b><br>
                        Make knowledge about SRI widely available <br>
                        Generate and advance knowledge and scientific understanding on SRI methodology <br>
                        Improve the technical SRI implementation in farmers' fields and experimental plots <br>
                        Strengthen the International SRI Community and its various networks <br>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Our core activities:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Knowledge Generation and Research</b><br>
                        We advance knowledge through our own analysis and research, and we advise partners either on
                        their research activities or technical implementation with farmer-based field programs. SRI-Rice
                        is a partner on the EU-financed project "Sustaining and Enhancing the Momentum for Innovation
                        and Learning around the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in the Lower Mekong River Basin,"
                        and participates in scientific projects, including a multi-country arsenic research study. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Technical Advice</b><br>
                        With many years of direct experience working with farmers on technical innovations, the SRI-Rice
                        team is active in providing technical advice and backstopping to field programs in several
                        countries. The advice ranges from farmer-centered implementation approaches to agronomic
                        techniques and practices. In the large 13-country three-year World Bank-funded scaling up
                        project for West Africa, SRI-Rice provided technical leadership, including monitoring and
                        evaluation, mapping, adaptation of production practices, and development of training materials.
